							<h1>Renzo Severino</h1>
							<p class="major">I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Sanford School of Public Policy in Duke University on the 2024-25 Job Market. My research focuses on minorities within Peruvian high schools – 
								such as immigrants and indigenous populations – and their interaction with actors within and outside the school system. You can find my CV <a href="Severino_CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>
							<p class="major">I am a member of the <a href="https://sites.duke.edu/devlab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Development Lab at Duke Department of 
								Economics</a> and a <a href="https://jhfc.duke.edu/academics/vdhfellows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024-25 von der Heyden Global Fellow at the John 
								Hope Franklin Center</a>. Before coming to Duke, I majored in Economics at Universidad del Pacifico, Peru.</p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>In my Job Market Paper I study the impacts over the academic performance of eighth graders in the context of a large and rapid inflow produced by the unprecedented exodus of Venezuelan families into Peru, 
							where the two-year inflow of Venezuelans was equivalent to 2.5% of the native population. I make use of exogenous classroom assignment within school-year units 
								to determine the effects of increased immigrant presence in classrooms on natives' academic performance. <i> Draft coming soon </i> </p>
							<p>I am also a co-Principal Investigator on a Randomized Controlled Trial in the Peruvian highlands related to Sexual Education for high-school native-language speakers. </p>
							<p>Before graduate school, I worked as a Research Assistant for a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19301175">project</a> about 
								the long-term impacts of a colonial forced labor system on Peruvian firms' outcomes today. </p>
